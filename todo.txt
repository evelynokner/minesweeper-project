TO DO
- rename variables such that they are consistent throughout project (count board, game board, x,y/row,col)
- make spelling of neighbours/neighbors consistent throughout project
- change order of gameboard & count_matrix being passed in methods so they are consistent
- rename modules and organize all methods and global variables/constants
    MODULES
        game (currently minesweeper.py & floodfill.py)
            def initialize_board(num_rows, num_cols)
            def move -> call dfs
            check if game is over
                - 3 states of game: continue, won, lost
                if game over, return indicator of result (win or loss)
                otherwise, return indicator of "game continues"

        web (currently hello.py)
            generate_html(gameboard, count_matrix)
            generate_html_table
            display_move
            urls (e.g. /move/row/col)
                result = move(row, col)
                    generate_html depending on result
                    if result = user lost game:
                        redirect("game lost")
                    else if result = game_over (user won)
                        redirect("game over")
                    else generate_html(gameboard changed by move)

        constants
            openedCell, closedCell, manually initialized boards for testing

- style board and pages, make separate css file
- generate board (don't use hard-coded board)
- find free deployment
- websockets javascript
- ai assistant
